# Project-Euler
## A repo for Project Euler solutions

To have some small problems to solve I'll be working through a few of the problems on the Project Euler website: https://projecteuler.net/

Initially I'll be working through these in C, but hope to complete some in other languages at a later date.

## Make
* 'make' compiles bin\project_euler.exe
* 'make test' compiles test\bin\test.exe
* 'make clean' cleans the main project
* 'make test_clean' cleans the test project
